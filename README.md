Parametric Wire Management Raceway for FRC Robots

We wanted to use professional raceway (Panduit) for our robot, because it allows for a very neat looking setup, while avoiding zip-ties.  We want to avoid zip ties for several reasons:

1. Time intensive to install
1. Must be cut off if you need to re-wire
1. Are frequently a safety hazard if not propertly trimmed. We've had team mambers be scratched by sharp nibs more than once.

In constrast with zipties, Raceway has a number of advantages:
1. faster to install. 
1. faster to open up for maintenance
1. MUCH MUCH faster to re-do or add a wire
1. allows using pre-purchased or pre-made standard cable lengths, because the slack can be neatly tucked away
1. Safer-- no little sharp zip-tie ends to poke/scratch
1. can be sized to match the job
1. looks way nicer


This model contains three parts:

  * A Cable raceway segment
  * A lid
  * A joint, which serves as both a "Tee" and and "Elbow"

The parts print flat, and are folded to make a lightweight, sturdy cable raceway. The dimensions are completly customizable, including:

  * The width, height, and length
  * The size of the fingers and slots

# Printing and Use Instructions

1. Configure your desired dimensions using Solidworks equations
1. Save as a .3mf file. The file contains three parts. A .3mf file will treat them separately. Alternatively, you can save each part individually as STL
1. Slice and print. PETG is recommended. PLA will not work unless you heat the parts to bend
1. Fold the sides up right when it comes off of the printer. This prevents the need for  heated bender.

# Using

The segments are connected to each other using a small bit of 1.75mm filament.  You can insert the filament and bend it, but it looks nicer to use a heat source ( like a soldering iron ) to mushroom the endsd of the filament so that it becomes a rivet.
